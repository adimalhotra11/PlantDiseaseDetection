Detecting Disease in Plants using Computer Vision - Inception V3 and CNN model.

### InceptionV3 Performance Remarks ###  
The model accuracy is around 83%. Since the validation accuracy is very close to the training accuracy, It is ideal as it is neither underfitting nor overfitting and is best what we can get from such a complex dataset.  


### CNN model Performance Remarks ###  
The model accuracy is around 97%. It is not ideal as it is underfitting since the training and validation loss are very dissimilar. ( being higher for validation dataset.)
